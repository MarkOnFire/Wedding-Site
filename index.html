						<p>We are movie theatre people. We both worked at different theatres during our teens and early twenties. We can usually be found catching up on our watch list at theatres around Madison or Chicago.The Orpheum holds a special place in our hearts: from attending Stage Door screenings and Wisconsin Film Festival movies in its heyday to comedy and music acts in its present-day resurgence, the historic space represents much of what we love about Madison past, present and future. We are excited to be part of the rebirth of the theatre and can’t wait to be a small part of its rich history.</p>

							<h3>They Met</h3>
						</header>
						<p>He worked at Eastgate Cinema. She worked at Point Cinema. The fates (or perhaps upper management) intervened, and Mark came to the west side one night to babysit the staff during a company party. They had never been happier to argue over film tastes and popcorn scooping technique. It was love at first sight.</p>
						<header>
							<h3>They Fell in love</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Mark and Laurie dated throughout college. They each graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison–Mark in 2010, Laurie in 2011.</p> <p>Mark began a career as a writer and media producer, freelancing for the Onion, the Isthmus, a few podcasts of his own and eventually settling in as a communicator for College of Engineering at his alma mater. Laurie joined the Schools of Hope AmeriCorps program, developing the passion for educating young kids that would lead her to Chicago to become an early childhood educator. Feeling a furry hole in their hearts, the pair adopted two rescue Boston terriers: Mac the speed demon made them a trio in August 2011, and Bacon the flatulent cuddled his way into their hearts in March 2014.</p>
						<header>
							<h3>The Went For It</h3>
						</header>
						<p>After six years of being together, weathering career changes, a move to Chicago in 2013 and that time that Bacon wouldn’t stop pooping in the house, Mark and Laurie knew they could do anything if they did it together.</p> <p>Mark dropped to his knee outside the Landmark Century Centre Cinema on January 31, 2014. There was no question in Laurie's mind.

						<div class="content">
							<h3>Mark Riechers</h3>
							<p>Mark, a soon to be 29-year-old writer and media guy, likes to play video games and drink dark beers. October is his favorite month because it’s a convenient excuse to watch 31 horror movies in a row. He loves to listen to indie bands, but will not apologize for his karaoke picks: “Out of Africa” by Toto, “Stronger” by Kelly Clarkson and “Shake it Off” by Taylor Swift. When his free time is not being taken up by freelance work, he enjoys cuddling puppies and eating all the bacon and eggs you have.

							<h3>Laurie Gebhard</h3>
							<p>Laurie, a 27-year-old preschool teacher, likes to binge watch shows on Netflix. She enjoys reading the occasional book when she can squeeze it into her TV schedule. Passionate about education and social justice, she can be heard ranting about politics and inequalities at all hours of the day and night when she’s not sipping on her bourbon Old Fashioned or eating her weight in dark chocolate. </p>

							<h3>Naomi Presley</h3>
							<h4>Maid of Honor</h4>
							<p>Naomi and Laurie met while serving on the Schools of Hope AmeriCorps Project. They bonded over their mutual love of tiny horses named Lil’ Sebastian and hatred of all the same people. They enjoy school-mailing each other silly poems, lost and found items and who knows how old candy that they found in their desk. Many a GChat has been had discussing the wonders of cat videos on the interwebs.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h3>Rachel Charon</h3>
							<p>Rachel and Laurie met while serving on the Schools of Hope AmeriCorps Project. They hit it off while on a work trip to Sheboygan where Laurie had to sleep in a boat bed and they ditched the social hour to eat ice cream and walk along the lake together. Laurie was lucky enough to be the sassy bridesmaid in Rachel’s wedding last summer.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h3>Lizzi Alstad</h3>
							<p>Mark and Lizzi met at Sun Prairie High School, and have been sending ENTIRELY UPPERCASE TEXTS ABOUT BEER AND ZELDA at each other for more than ten years. Lizzi truly understands how Mark’s brain works; in fact: they have the same spirit animal, which is probably some kind of helpful badger–overwhelmingly kind but thirsty for bloody vengeance when crossed.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h3>Kelsey Kosterman</h3>
							<p>Kelsey and Laurie met while working at the popcorn mines of Marcus Point Cinema more than ten years ago. Kelsey swept Laurie off her feet as her senior prom date. They deny their involvement with a group that purportedly tagged cars with “Vegetable Medley” in washable paint. </p>

							<h3>Kelley Logan</h3>
							<p>Kelley and Laurie met during their summer institute training while serving with Teach for America. Their mutual love of preschoolers, Mean Girls and brunch brought them together instantly. Frequent Snapchat exchanges: cute but unruly children; burritos; hard liquor. In that order.</p>

						<h3>Adam Krajewski</h3>
						<h4>Best Man</h4>
						<p>Adam has saved Mark’s life on numerous occasions, including but not limited to: 1) telling him to stop eating pudding from the dorm cafeteria with every meal, 2) playing Gears of War with him until sun rise to calm down after Spider-Man 3 was THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE SERIOUSLY OH MY GOD, 3) escaping the lair of the Mole People.

						<h3>Zach Wagner</h3>
						<p>Zach may be the most patient human Mark knows of–he tolerated Mark’s rabid cleaning tendencies way beyond what any normal roommate should bear. That’s the sort of friendship that years of school together (and that time they shared a beer that Mark found in a river) will earn you.  </p>

						<p>Dan and Mark went to high school together, and knew each other throughout college, when Mark became Dan’s Street Fighter dealer/roommate. Legends say that Dan emerged fully formed from the carcass of a bear that had been struck by lightning, but actually Mark met his parents and they’re quite nice.</p>

						<h3>Eric Backes</h3>
						<p>Eric and Laurie met while making magical movie memories at Marcus Point Cinema more than ten years ago. They know nothing about the missing Gum Away and scorch marks behind theatre 6. Or the time capsule buried behind the dumpsters. </p>

						<h3>Scott Gordon</h3>
						<p>Scott hired Mark as his intern at the Onion in 2009. He liked to yell at things, which Mark appreciated deeply. When Scott wanted to start a podcast about yelling about the arts, Mark figured out how to record live podcasts from the back rooms of Madison bars; three years later, that project has since evolved into a many-headed beast known as Tone Madison.</p>

					<h3>Cassie Melotte</h3>
					<h4>Officiant</h4>
					<p>Cassie and Laurie met while selling tickets to Shrek at the box office of Marcus Point Cinema more than ten years ago. Cassie is responsible for Laurie’s love of hummus and BBQ chips. Cassie told Laurie about this amazing program called AmeriCorps and thus is partly to blame for Laurie’s passion for teaching.</p>

					<h3>Nicole Isaacs</h3>
					<h4>Usher</h4>
					<p>Laurie and Nicole met at UW-Madison when they lived together on Regent Street. Nicole kept the peace in the house by belting Lady Gaga at 3 AM and by holding court as Judgy McJudgerton. Nicole has shared her conspiracy theory about gingers with tails and now Laurie can never look at Ron Weasley the same again.</p>

				<div class="content">
					<h3>Carter Gebhard</h3>
					<h4>Ring Bearer</h4>
					<p>Carter is Laurie’s youngest nephew who will be starting second grade in the fall. He loves to play video games and boss Mark around, and does not take a Mario Kart loss lightly. Has likely re-created the Orpheum Theatre in Minecraft by now, so he can help out if you get lost.</p>

					<h3>Grace Gordon, Emma Gordon and Eliza Gordon</h3>
					<h4>Dog Handlers</h4>
					<p>Grace, Emma and Eliza are Laurie’s cousins. They are stylish, athletic and sassy. Laurie says they take after her. Except the athleticism. Those are some freak of nature genes from their amazing parents. </p>
				</div>

			<section class="feature left">
				<a href="#" class="image icon"><img src="images/dogs.jpg" alt="dogs" /></a>
				<div class="content">
					<h3>Mac and Bacon</h3>
					<h4>Dogs</h4>
					<p>Mac joined Mark and Laurie’s life in 2011. Little did they realize how much this little lady would change everything. After they moved to Chicago and Miss Mac was bored in the big city, they adopted Bacon in 2014. At first Mac wasn’t sure about her farty new brother, but they became fast friends. Laurie and Mark can’t imagine their life without these two cuddly little monsters and like to spoil them rotten. </p>
